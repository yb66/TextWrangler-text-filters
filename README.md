This has moved to [BBEdit stuff](https://github.com/yb66/BBEdit-stuff), mainly because I wanted to keep more than just text filters. Stuff may be in 2 locations for a while as I want to review any scripts that make it to the new repo.

# TextWrangler text filters #

Just drop any of these in `~/Library/Application Support/TextWrangler/Text Filters` to use. I'm running a version of Ruby higher than the OS X system one, so try to update to something recent (2.2 or more).

## Note ##

These should all work with BBEdit (I'm using them with that nowadays). Just replace "TextWrangler" with BBEdit to find the right place to install them. I've aalso started cloning this repo straight into the Text Filters folder with `git clone https://github.com/yb66/TextWrangler-text-filters.git "~/Library/Application/Support/BBEdit/Text Filters"` to save myself time, and the trouble of losing any the next time my laptop dies (grrrr!)
